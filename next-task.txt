For each square in the grid
1) check use itâ€™s box id # to get coordinates
2) generate a list of the 9 possible coordinates around it
3) use coordinates to get object ids for possible surrounding coordinate that exist
4) iterate through existing objects. Increment number in box for each red or lightblue
5) set innerText of box to number



loop through to increment number boxes



//
find all boxes around lava and increment then


combine is gem or lava into one thing


coodinates: name


precalculating the values 

plus signs recurse check

base case: when you can't explore x +1 x -1 y+1 y-1

front load neighbors:

//next
write a function that given a box returns a list of neighbors

What is the input what is the output

get the x/y in the keystone
